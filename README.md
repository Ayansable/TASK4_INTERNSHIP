Firewall Configuration and Testing Report
##Objective
To configure, test, and manage firewall rules on Windows/Linux systems, and understand how a firewall filters network traffic.
##Tools Used
Windows Firewall (Windows OS)
Command Line / Terminal
Optional: Remote connection tools (e.g., telnet, ssh) for testing

##Navigating to Windows Firewall with Advanced Security

Deleting rules after testing

##Summary â€“ How Firewall Filters Traffic
A firewall acts as a network filter by applying rules to inbound and outbound traffic.

##Filtering Criteria:
Port numbers (e.g., block port 23)
Protocols (TCP/UDP)
IP addresses or ranges
Applications or services
Action: Allow, Deny, or Log connections based on defined rules.
Effect: Only authorized traffic passes, while unwanted traffic is blocked, enhancing system security.
